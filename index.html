    <h1>Sajeev</h1>
    <p>I am a human being.</p>
    <p>At 17, I dropped out of school and it changed my life forever.</p>
    <p>I worked as a party promoter; the money was alright, the experience was priceless.</p>
    <p>At 19, I lost my job and found the world of crypto.</p>
    <p>I took a risk investing and it paid handsomely â€” the truth is, I just got lucky.</p>
    <p>By 21, I lived as I pleased, yet lacked fulfilment.</p>
    <p>Seeking freedom, I found myself trapped as I adopted ideals that did not belong to me.</p>
    <p class="spaced-line">I questioned the life I lived...</p>
    <p>I read Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method at the LSE.</p>
